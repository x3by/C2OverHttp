# Test C2 Over HTTP

in this repository there is an educational project of a Command and Iontrol server that commands a list of compromised machines and on which the "`agent`" for bots runs.

## Disclaimer

The project is trivial but at the time of writing it can evade some `AV` so do not use it on infrastructures that you do not have permissions.
